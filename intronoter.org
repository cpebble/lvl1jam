#+TITLE:Why game jam?
* Why game jam?
Speaker: Mads johansen @ mads<>
** Motivations:
- It's not about winning
- Try something new
- It's important to practice your craft.
  - You always go through the same thing
  - This is a chance to deep dive into something new, or something you
    don't use that often
- Finish a thing!

** Practical:
- It's ok not to conform to the usual structure
- It's ok to not have a team, idea, plan or any idea what you're doing
  - Mingle and network!
- Remember to mingle

** What can a game jam provide?
- New friends
- Networking^^
- Motivational working environment
- Tons of game testers, for when people take breaks from projects
- *TAkE BREAkS*
  


** Game jam structure:
*** Coming up with a game and prototype: 1-2 hours
*** Start over or playtest and iterate: 2-4h
*** Start over or add content and feel, playtest, UI. Tutorial: 1-2 days
**** Content: Don't even bother. just make a fun toy

** Scoping!
- 5 mins of game jam
- Make core loop fun
- Local multiplayer can be fun. Might not mean game is good, but might make
  it more fun to develop
** Tools:
- What youre comfortable with(unless your goal is to try new things)
- Use single-focus tools.
  - SFXR/BFXR for sound
  - GFX: Ogmo 2d editor
  - GFX: Dame 2d editor


* Inspirational talk
Speaker: Amanda Rasmussen <amanda@spilvaerk.dk>
** Anti-Imposter syndrome in five steps
- Thick-rimmed glasse
- Lots of stickers
- Use words like "agency" and "immersion"
- ???(designy things)
- Profit!!

** Imposter syndrome
The assumption that you know a lot less than everyone else.
The fear of being a fraud.

The reality is that most people are close to you in level,
talk to them, mingle, network and enjoy

** Aknowledge your differences
While you may intend to create a /horse/, the artist might
envision a /unicorn/ and the programmer a /camel/

** Is your idea doable?
Make sure that What you think, reflects real life.
Make sure that your ideas are doable in the alotted time

** Be silly! <3
